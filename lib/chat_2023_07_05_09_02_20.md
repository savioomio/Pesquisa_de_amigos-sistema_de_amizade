This is the code for your functions.php file. Let's go through it step by step:

1. The first line includes the "conn.php" file, which presumably contains the database connection code.

2. The function "carrega_pagina" is defined. It checks if the requested page exists in the "pags/" directory and includes it if it does. If the page does not exist, it displays an error message.

3. The function "get_perfil" retrieves the user profile information from the database based on the provided username. It then displays the profile information and calls the "verfica_solicitacoes" function.

4. The function "verifica_amizade" checks if there is a pending friend request between two users based on their usernames. It returns the count of such requests.

5. The function "send_solicitation" sends a friend request from the currently logged-in user to the specified user. It first checks if there is no pending request between the two users. If there is no pending request, it inserts a new row in the "amigo" table with the sender's and receiver's usernames.

6. The function "verfica_solicitacoes" checks if there are any pending friend requests between the currently logged-in user and the specified user. It displays appropriate buttons based on the status of the requests.

7. The function "deleta_solicitacao" deletes a friend request from the "amigo" table based on the provided request ID.

8. The function "recusar_solicitacao" deletes a friend request from the "amigo" table based on the provided request ID. It is used when the currently logged-in user wants to decline a friend request.

9. The function "aceita_solicitacao" accepts a friend request between the currently logged-in user and the specified user. It first checks if there is a pending request between the two users. If there is a pending request, it updates the status of the request to 1 (accepted).

10. The function "atualiza_solicitacao" updates the status of a friend request between two users to 1 (accepted). It is called by the "aceita_solicitacao" function.

11. The function "redireciona" redirects the user to the specified URL.

12. The function "solicitacoes" retrieves and displays all pending friend requests for the currently logged-in user. It displays the sender's username and provides buttons to accept or decline the requests.

13. The function "return_total_solicitation" returns the total number of pending friend requests for the currently logged-in user.

That's it! These functions handle various aspects of friend requests and user profiles. Let me know if you have any specific questions or need further assistance.
